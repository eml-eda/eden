EDEN: Efficient Decision tree Ensemble
======================================

eden is a python module that enables a fast deployment of tree-based models at the edge.

It converts a sklearn model into a custom model, eventually performing a post-training 
quantization of the tree fields.
Finally, it generates C templates of ensemble, allowing a fast deployment at the edge.
More info at https://github.com/eml-eda/eden.
